## Jump2Digital
**25 - 03 - 2023 Barcelona**

It was my second Hackathon, I had gone before to one created by <a href="https://www.fundaciontelefonica.com/empleabilidad/campus-42/">Campus 42</a> and <a href="https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/es/itacademy">IT Academy</a>.

On this occasion, Jump2Digital proposed a challenge that consisted of forming teams of 6 with people you didn't know and propose solutions to the companies that were at the event. The challenge was to develop a web app that would improve warehouse logistics and make it easier to reach more customers.

My team's proposal, with which we won, was a website with an algorithm that showed in graphs and maps how the business should be built to get the maximum profitability.

Nuwe was the organizing company.
