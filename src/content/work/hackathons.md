> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

In these competitions, I learned that _soft skills_ are
as important as skills. Teamwork, setting realistic goals and good logistics are very important. It doesn't matter how good you are if you don't know how to handle the basics.

## Jump2Digital

**25 - 03 - 2023 _Barcelona_**

It was my second Hackathon, I had gone before to one created by <a href="https://www.fundaciontelefonica.com/empleabilidad/campus-42/">Campus 42</a> and <a href="https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/es/itacademy">IT Academy</a>.

On this occasion, <a href="https://barcelonadigitaltalent.com/jump2digital/">Jump2Digital</a> proposed a challenge that consisted of forming teams of 6 with people you didn't know and propose solutions to the companies that were at the event. The challenge was to develop a web app that would improve warehouse logistics and make it easier to reach more customers.

My team's proposal, with which we won, was a website with an algorithm that showed in graphs and maps how the business should be built to get the maximum profitability.

## Vueling Tech Hack

**17 - 04 - 2023 _Barcelona_**

A video summary of the event is available on LinkedIn. This time, Vueling asked us to create an App that will calculate which would be the cheapest staff you would have to hire for each flight and how to manage the shifts of your staff.

My team proposed a responsive app, as did all the teams. The winning team was the one that got the most efficient algorithm and the app to work on the internet with the fewest possible bugs. All this was done in one day.

## JOBarcelona2023

**25 - 03 - 2023 _Barcelona_**

This event was to be held at Barça's Camp Nou, but due to construction work it was held at the Palau Blaugrana.

Nuwe proposed as a challenge to raise awareness of women's soccer. Then, all the teams proposed web apps that would give you summaries of the leagues and teams. As well as the data of the players.

My team proposed a CRUD of all the data of women's sports. The database was in MongoDB and the FrontEnd created some templates with graphs for the statistics of the players and teams.

## Tech4Good

**21 - 07 - 2023 _Barcelona_**

_A meeting promoted and organized by Barcelona Activa and Mobile World Capital Barcelona with the participation of 11 code academies of the city._

The objective of the Tech4Good hackathon focuses on addressing one of the five challenges proposed by the organization and based on the 2030 Agenda using the open database platform of the Barcelona City Council Open Data BCN. The challenges are linked to the Sustainable Development Goals and were: drought in the city of Barcelona, inclusive and quality education, the promotion of local trade, sustainable tourism and the promotion of gender parity in public office.

Through multidisciplinary working groups, participants had to respond and propose solutions to one of the five challenges. The groups were made up of various programming specialists including Data Science, Front-End and Back-End teams, with specific tasks and objectives for each discipline. All the members had to find a creative, innovative and original solution to the challenge of their choice and, during the second day of work, present it to a jury.

Finally, the hackathon jury chose the team that has promoted the project 'Des/vía', a website that decongests the most frequented areas of Barcelona with the aim of promoting sustainable tourism and helping the local economy. The members of the winning group have received as a prize tickets for the Mobile World Congress 2024 and for the Cruce 2023 festival, as well as a guided tour of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.
